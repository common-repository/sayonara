Finally! A popup builder, fully supported, regularly updated, secure, and free. No monthly subscriptions required with external companies. Includes popups that can be triggered by exit, delay or scroll.

== Description ==

Sayonara exists because I spent far too long searching for a fully supported, secure and up-to-date popup builder that I could set to trigger when a user exited a site.

Sayonara detects when a user is about to leave, and displays a popup. If you are after something different, Sayonara can also be triggered based on how far down a page a user scrolls, or even after a specified amount of time has passed.

And because some pop-ups can convert up to 40% of your website visitors into subscribers and leads, Sayonara is good for your business.
